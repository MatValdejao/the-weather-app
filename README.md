# the-weather-app

## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to inform the user about weather conditions at a specified city. The user inputs a city of choice and the program returns data about the current day's weather, including temperature, humidity, wind, and the UV Index. The program also dynamically generates HTML and displays the weather forecast for the specified city for 5 days including, expected temperature, humidity, and wind speeds. 

Finally, the application saves past user searches so that the user can simply click on a "historical" button and display the weather for the saved city.
